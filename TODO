- add doxygen documentation to stubfactory.cpp
- Add auto-generated comment header
- long-term: remove "using namespace" directives from output and replace with fully qualified names
- clean up memory usage. Right now none of the ownership guidelines for clang are being followed. There
  are memory leaks galore. Need to make sure things are cleaned up properly
- Figure out how to initialize argument capture and default return values. This must be done
  both in the declaration of the variables at the top of the output, and in the reset() function
- generate a header for each stub that can extern all of the helper variables. This can be easily
  done by hand in a unit test module by copying what's at the top of the stub output and adding "extern"
